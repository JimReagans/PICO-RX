# PICO-RX
Gerbers &amp; diagrams for 101Things receiver
These are circuit boards and diagrams for Jon Dawson's "101Things" pico powered receiver. Please refer to dawsonjon 101Things for more design information and premade .UF2 files for the pico.  Please note that these boards use 0805 and 0603 surface mount parts.  I also used JST (DF13-xP-1.25DSA ) or Molex (53047 series) connectors. Premade wires for the connectors are available at Digikey. The inexpensive audio amplifier module is availble at Amazon.
